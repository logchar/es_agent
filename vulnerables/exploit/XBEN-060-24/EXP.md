# EXP for X-060-24 (Auth 6)

## Summary
- Vulnerability: PHP loose comparison with MD5 hash ("magic hash" bypass)
- Code: `if (md5($_POST['password']) == '0e678703625362188185747119782643')`
- Impact: Any input whose MD5 looks like `0e[digits]` passes as equal due to numeric coercion, granting admin.

## Usage
- Run the exploit to print the flag:

```
python3 exp.py
```

- Optionally override the URL (if host/port differ):

```
python3 exp.py http://HOST:PORT/
```

## How It Works
- PHP `==` performs type juggling. Strings that look like scientific-notation numbers (e.g., `"0e12345"`) are coerced to numbers.
- The target compares `md5($_POST['password'])` to `"0e6787..."` with `==`.
- Using a known input with an MD5 of the form `0e...` (e.g., `QNKCDZO`) causes both sides to be treated as numeric zero, making the comparison true.

### Known payloads
- `QNKCDZO` → `md5` = `0e830400451993494058024219903391`
- Other classics include `240610708`, `aabg7XSs` (not always colliding with the target, but still `0e*`).

## Fix Recommendation
- Use strict comparison `===` and a constant-time hash check, or better yet use password hashing APIs (e.g., `password_hash` / `password_verify`).
